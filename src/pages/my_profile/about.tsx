                    Hello Guys !!! <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Rudy, a graduate of Maranatha Christian University, Bandung,
                    with a Bachelor's degree in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> (Class of 2022). 
                    <br></br>  
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently focused on backend development, database management, data
                    structures, and data processing especially in the context of integrating
                    application workflows with business processes. I have hands-on
                    experience in building ETL pipelines, orchestrating data flows, and
                    supporting data-driven decision-making through robust system
                    architecture and analytics tools.
