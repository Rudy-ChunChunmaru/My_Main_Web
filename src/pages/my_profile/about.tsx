                    Hello Guys !!! <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Rudy. Im from Sanggau, West Borneo -
                    Indonesia and now I live on west java. I worked as a full stack
                    web developer application and studied IoT several times, studied a
                    little data analysis, robotics and networking.
                    <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like programming and mechanics,
                    control systems. Sometimes learning it makes your head hurt, but
                    sometimes when you've succeeded, you feel oh it's really really
                    not difficult at all hahaha. that my introductions, thank you
                </p>
